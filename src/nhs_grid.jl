    GridNeighborhoodSearch{NDIMS}(; search_radius = 0.0, n_points = 0,
                                  periodic_box = nothing,

Simple grid-based neighborhood search with uniform search radius.
The domain is divided into a regular grid.
For each (non-empty) grid cell, a list of points in this cell is stored.
Instead of representing a finite domain by an array of cells, a potentially infinite domain
is represented by storing cell lists in a hash table (using Julia's `Dict` data structure),
indexed by the cell index tuple
```math
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor \right) \quad \text{or} \quad
\left( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{y}{d} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{z}{d} \right\rfloor \right),
```
where ``x, y, z`` are the space coordinates and ``d`` is the search radius.

To find points within the search radius around a position, only points in the neighboring
cells are considered.

See also (Chalela et al., 2021), (Ihmsen et al. 2011, Section 4.4).

As opposed to (Ihmsen et al. 2011), we do not sort the points in any way,
since not sorting makes our implementation a lot faster (although less parallelizable).

# Arguments
- `NDIMS`: Number of dimensions.

# Keywords
- `search_radius = 0.0`:    The fixed search radius. The default of `0.0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `n_points = 0`:           Total number of points. The default of `0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `periodic_box = nothing`: In order to use a (rectangular) periodic domain, pass a
                            [`PeriodicBox`](@ref).
- `cell_list`:              The cell list that maps a cell index to a list of points inside
                            the cell. By default, a [`DictionaryCellList`](@ref) is used.
- `threaded_update = true`: Can be used to deactivate thread parallelization in the
                            neighborhood search update. This can be one of the largest
                            sources of variations between simulations with different
                            thread numbers due to neighbor ordering changes.
