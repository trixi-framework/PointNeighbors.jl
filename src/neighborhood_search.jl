"""
    initialize!(search::AbstractNeighborhoodSearch, x, y)

Initialize a neighborhood search with the two coordinate arrays `x` and `y`.

In general, the purpose of a neighborhood search is to find for one point in `x`
all points in `y` whose distances to that point are smaller than the search radius.
`x` and `y` are expected to be matrices, where the `i`-th column contains the coordinates
of point `i`. Note that `x` and `y` can be identical.

See also [`update!`](@ref).
"""
@inline initialize!(search::AbstractNeighborhoodSearch, x, y) = search

"""
    update!(search::AbstractNeighborhoodSearch, x, y; points_moving = (true, true))

Update an already initialized neighborhood search with the two coordinate arrays `x` and `y`.

Like [`initialize!`](@ref), but reusing the existing data structures of the already
initialized neighborhood search.
When the points only moved a small distance since the last `update!` or `initialize!`,
this is significantly faster than `initialize!`.

Not all implementations support incremental updates.
If incremental updates are not possible for an implementation, `update!` will fall back
to a regular `initialize!`.

Some neighborhood searches might not need to update when only `x` changed since the last
`update!` or `initialize!` and `y` did not change. Pass `points_moving = (true, false)`
in this case to avoid unnecessary updates.
The first flag in `points_moving` indicates if points in `x` are moving.
The second flag indicates if points in `y` are moving.

    copy_neighborhood_search(search::AbstractNeighborhoodSearch, search_radius, n_points;
                             eachpoint = 1:n_points)

Create a new **uninitialized** neighborhood search of the same type and with the same
configuration options as `search`, but with a different search radius and number of points.

The [`TrivialNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref) also requires an iterator `eachpoint`, which most
of the time will be `1:n_points`. If the `TrivialNeighborhoodSearch` is never going to be
used, the keyword argument `eachpoint` can be ignored.

This is useful when a simulation code requires multiple neighborhood searches of the same
kind. One can then just pass an empty neighborhood search as a template and use
this function inside the simulation code to generate similar neighborhood searches with
different search radii and different numbers of points.
```jldoctest; filter = r"GridNeighborhoodSearch{2,.*"
# Template
nhs = GridNeighborhoodSearch{2}()

# Inside the simulation code, generate similar neighborhood searches
nhs1 = copy_neighborhood_search(nhs, 1.0, 100)

# output
GridNeighborhoodSearch{2, Float64, ...}(...)
