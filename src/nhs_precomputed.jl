    PrecomputedNeighborhoodSearch{NDIMS}(; search_radius = 0.0, n_points = 0,
                                         periodic_box = nothing, update_strategy = nothing)

Neighborhood search with precomputed neighbor lists. A list of all neighbors is computed
for each point during initialization and update.
This neighborhood search maximizes the performance of neighbor loops at the cost of a much
slower [`update!`](@ref).

A [`GridNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref) is used internally to compute the neighbor lists during
initialization and update.

# Arguments
- `NDIMS`: Number of dimensions.

# Keywords
- `search_radius = 0.0`:    The fixed search radius. The default of `0.0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `n_points = 0`:           Total number of points. The default of `0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `periodic_box = nothing`: In order to use a (rectangular) periodic domain, pass a
                            [`PeriodicBox`](@ref).
- `update_strategy`:        Strategy to parallelize `update!` of the internally used
                            `GridNeighborhoodSearch`. See [`GridNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref)
                            for available options.
