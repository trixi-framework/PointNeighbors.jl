    PrecomputedNeighborhoodSearch{NDIMS}(; search_radius = 0.0, n_points = 0,
                                         periodic_box = nothing, threaded_update = true)

Neighborhood search with precomputed neighbor lists. A list of all neighbors is computed
for each point during initialization and update.
This neighborhood search maximizes the performance of neighbor loops at the cost of a much
slower [`update!`](@ref).

A [`GridNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref) is used internally to compute the neighbor lists during
initialization and update.

# Arguments
- `NDIMS`: Number of dimensions.

# Keywords
- `search_radius = 0.0`:    The fixed search radius. The default of `0.0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `n_points = 0`:           Total number of points. The default of `0` is useful together
                            with [`copy_neighborhood_search`](@ref).
- `periodic_box = nothing`: In order to use a (rectangular) periodic domain, pass a
                            [`PeriodicBox`](@ref).
- `threaded_update = true`: Can be used to deactivate thread parallelization in the
                            neighborhood search update. This can be one of the largest
                            sources of variations between simulations with different
                            thread numbers due to neighbor ordering changes.
