Semantically the same as `Threads.@threads` when iterating over a `AbstractUnitRange`
but without guarantee that the underlying implementation uses `Threads.@threads`
or works for more general `for` loops.
In particular, there may be an additional check whether only one thread is used
to reduce the overhead of serial execution or the underlying threading capabilities
might be provided by other packages such as [Polyester.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSIMD/Polyester.jl).

!!! warn
    This macro does not necessarily work for general `for` loops. For example,
    it does not necessarily support general iterables such as `eachline(filename)`.

    # However, the code below using `@batch` from Polyester.jl is more efficient,
    # since this packages provides threads with less overhead. Since it is written
    # by Chris Elrod, the author of LoopVectorization.jl, we expect this package
    # to provide the most efficient and useful implementation of threads (as we use
    # them) available in Julia.
    # !!! danger "Heisenbug"
    #     Look at the comments for `wrap_array` when considering to change this macro.
