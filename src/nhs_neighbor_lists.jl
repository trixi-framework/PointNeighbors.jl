Neighborhood search with precomputed neighbor lists. A list of all neighbors is computed
for each particle during initialization and update.
This neighborhood search maximizes the performance of neighbor loops at the cost of a much
slower [`update!`](@ref).

A [`GridNeighborhoodSearch`](@ref) is used internally to compute the neighbor lists during
initialization and update.

# Arguments
- `NDIMS`:          Number of dimensions.
- `search_radius`:  The uniform search radius.
- `n_particles`:    Total number of particles.

# Keywords
- `periodic_box_min_corner`:    In order to use a (rectangular) periodic domain, pass the
                                coordinates of the domain corner in negative coordinate
                                directions.
- `periodic_box_max_corner`:    In order to use a (rectangular) periodic domain, pass the
                                coordinates of the domain corner in positive coordinate
                                directions.
