"""
    benchmark_n_body(neighborhood_search, coordinates; parallel = true)

A simple neighborhood search benchmark, computing the right-hand side of an n-body
simulation with a cutoff (corresponding to the search radius of `neighborhood_search`).

This is a more realistic benchmark for particle-based simulations than
[`benchmark_count_neighbors`](@ref).
However, due to the higher computational cost, differences between neighborhood search
implementations are less pronounced.
